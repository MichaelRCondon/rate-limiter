## Simple Go rate limiter
This is built mostly as an excuse to learn Go, so it's confined to a relatively small footprint. 
The system will be distributed, scalable, and deployable as a demo in a small set of docker containers. 

If it goes beyond that, and becomes a usable piece of software, this will be updated with more details. For now this is very much a work-in-progress.
